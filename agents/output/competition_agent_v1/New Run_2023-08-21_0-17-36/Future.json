Users appreciate the tailored workouts and the one-on-one attention they receive from their coaches. They have also noted that the onboarding process is not time-consuming and the app is easy to navigate without any distracting features. However, there are some issues with the app's syncing with the Apple Watch, and users have reported that they sometimes have to manually advance to the next exercise. Despite this, customers have praised the app for its effectiveness and ease of use. The app does come with a monthly fee, and some users may find the cost of $149 a month to be a bit steep. Despite the cost, many users seem to find the personalized attention and tailored workouts to be worth the price.", "strengths": "Users appreciate the tailored workouts and the one-on-one attention they receive from their coaches.
